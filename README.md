# Digit-Recognizer || 94% Accuracy 

AI-Based Digit Recognizer (No ML Libraries)

# Description:
This project is a simple AI-powered digit recognizer built from scratch without using any machine learning or deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn. It uses only Pandas for loading and processing the MNIST dataset and Matplotlib for data visualization and debugging.

The core of the recognizer is implemented using fundamental programming techniques such as matrix operations, manually defined activation functions (like sigmoid or ReLU), and basic neural network logic coded in pure Python. The network is trained using the backpropagation algorithm with gradient descent to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
